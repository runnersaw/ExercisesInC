## Written sprint reflection

#### Personal Learning Goals

My personal learning goals were to inspect advanced exploitation techniques for C and write code that is safer. I also wanted to learn about the general state of security and what you should be doing in order to secure your computer from hackers. Overall, progress on these goals went well. We found a lot of information about many different exploitation techniques. We have understood and implemented code that could reasonably be in a project and yet is at risk of exploitation. 

One of our major shortcomings was a lack of information sharing about exploits and vulnerabilities that we found individually. We need to find a framework for sharing information with each other. We have some ideas, such as code and write-up reviews with each other. As we work on more and more advanced techniques, we will likely move to a structure in which we are working at the same time on a bug or exploitation technique.

#### EduScrum Reflection

We were unprepared because we did not meet before the sprint review in person and make sure that we were on the same page. We should do a stand-up (in-person or online) each day in order to make sure that we have a coherent plan in order to prepare for sprint reviews.

We did a good job of using our Trello board as a good organization for our sprint. We were on top of tasks and moved them into the proper categories.

We have a pretty informal stand-up at the beginning of every meeting. We also do one at the end of every meeting that is forward-looking and makes sure that we know what tasks each of us will be working on before the next class. 

## Head First C exercises

I only completed Head First C chapter one exercise 1 in this sprint. I feel very confident in my knowledge of C, so I prioritized researching and investigating future project work in order to ensure the viability of this moving forward. I plan on catching up to where the class should be by the end of sprint 2. [The first homework can be found here](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftwareSystems/tree/master/hw01).

## Think OS reading question answers

I also only completed Think OS chapter one in this sprint. I meant to be on track with this one, as I feel it is very important to me and relevant to my learning goals to do this. However, I became too engrossed in finishing our sprint 1 work and didn't get to Think OS. I plan on catching up to where the class should be by the end of sprint 2. [My answers can be found here](https://github.com/runnersaw/ExercisesInC/blob/master/reading_questions/thinkos.md).

## Exam question(s) and solution

Examine the following piece of code:

```
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  char str[] = "String literal";
  
  int *y = malloc(sizeof(int));
  
  return 0;
}
```

Order the value of the following things, from high to low:

- The memory address of x
- The memory address of y
- The value of y
- The memory address of str
- The memory address of "String literal"
- The location of the compiled code
