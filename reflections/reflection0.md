## Team Formation

The process of team formation wasn't very effective. I felt that discussions in such large groups that I ended up in weren't effective because I think that there were too many people to have a constructive discussion. In addition, it seems that people didn't have any ideas of what they wanted to do because they hadn't had any time to think about it. I also think that I had an idea that I really wanted to do but I wanted to find people who were excited about it rather than bringing it up in front of a huge group of people.

## Team Goals and Decisions

Our team joined because we felt very excited about the same idea (computer security and running exploits on a phone). We haven't discussed individual goals that differ from each other. 

To decide upon the scrum master, we simply talked about who was willing to do it and had skills that fit the position. As far as dividing responsibilities, our current sprint plan has lots of research and exercises that all of us will be required to do, so we haven't run into any tasks in which we've already had to make decisions about how to split up the work.

Our sprint backlog includes tasks from two main priorities: finding a previous jailbreak to research and reverse engineer, and researching general exploitation techniques. These feel like the first two logical tasks. We have plans to download and attempt to jailbreak the phone from source code in the next sprint and create write-ups of how the exploit works.

I'm still apprehensive because this is a thing that we aren't sure how much time it will take. Researching and finding exploits could lead us into very complicated code or we might be able to understand and reverse engineer it from technical write-ups and source code.
