# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

They are intending to set two different arrays, one with all 42s and one that goes from 1 to SIZE.
However, they didn't realize that the array allocated on the stack would be removed after the function returns, so they unintentionally
overwrote their original array (which they had a pointer to after it had been removed from the stack).

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

"warning: function returns address of local variable". This means that the first function is attempting to return the address of a 
variable created on the stack inside the function, so it is warning you because that variable will be deallocated soon.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

```
0x7fffdb4b0040
0x7fffdb4b0040
0
1
2
3
4
```

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

```
0
0
-905879936
32748
-905792208
```

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
